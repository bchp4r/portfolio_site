They come from all over the world to experience the "Burning Man Festival," a project of love, art and technology that celebrated its 29th birthday in 2014 with over 60.000 participants in attendance. The innovation that has emerged from the "Burning Man Festival" has touched every discipline imaginable in the North American culture and through this the global landscape. After eight days of subsistence entropy, the utopian village disappears without a trace (on site). A return to "home, to what is important" and "freedom" were recurring descriptions by "burners" when they shared with me the event's meaning.People from all walks of life, nearly every culture and generation come together to share. </div>

			  After five years of photographing this unique community, I have come to understand the concept of radical inclusion, all are welcome and accepted at Black Rock. In the world of "Burning Man" I observed and captured colorful citizens, loving and open people, sunrises, sunsets, landscapes natural and man-made, all presenting an alternative world, an experiment free of religious ties, bureaucratic border patrols, political barriers, conspicuous consumerism, where all are welcome. It is a world in which we are each different, but interdependent, where we need much less than what we have to survive with dignity. Black Rock offers a refuge, an awakening in which we can educate, dance, create and be happy without losing sight of what really matters, life in freedom with others.</div>
